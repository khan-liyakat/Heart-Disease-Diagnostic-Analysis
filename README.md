# Heart-Disease-Diagnostic-Analysis
Extract:
I have extracted the data from the heart disease diagnostic database.

Transform:
I have cleaned the data, handled missing values, and transformed it into a suitable format for analysis. Additionally, I have calculated additional metrics if needed.

Load:
I have loaded the transformed data into a DataFrame for further analysis.

Now, let's perform EDA:

Heart Disease Rates:

I have visualized the distribution of heart disease diagnosis.
Analyzed the trends over time, if available.
Heart Disease by Gender:

I have compared the prevalence of heart disease between genders.
Plotted bar charts or pie charts to illustrate the distribution.
Heart Disease by Age:

I have analyzed the distribution of heart disease across different age groups.
Plotted histograms or box plots to visualize the age distribution.
Key Metrics and Factors:

I have calculated key metrics such as mean, median, and standard deviation of relevant variables.
Identified factors that correlate with heart disease diagnosis (e.g., cholesterol levels, blood pressure).
Relationships Between Attributes:

I have explored correlations between different attributes using scatter plots or correlation matrices.
Analyzed the impact of various factors on heart disease diagnosis through regression analysis or similar techniques.
Dashboard Creation:
Using libraries like Plotly, Matplotlib, or Seaborn, I have created an interactive dashboard incorporating the visualizations from our EDA. The dashboard provides an intuitive interface for users to explore the data and understand key insights easily.
